The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with the interactions between
C++ classes and blueprints, and the features that it displays were made primarily
using C++ classes.

Some of these features are collisions, player and camera movement, spawning of objects
and NPCs, pickups, HUD, and animations. 

The repo includes only the project's source code.
